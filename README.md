# Raytrce
One week project by Peter Shirley (https://github.com/petershirley).
This project was made by following an online tutorial.

Current focus is on performance improvements:
- parallel computation.
- Binary output file, may change to .jpeg or .png format.
- Relay on ram memory instead of printing each row of pixels to a file.
